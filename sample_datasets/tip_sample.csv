I bought a 2.5 year Membership and if you paid in full when you sign up they offer you ""Six Months Free"" yeah right! Don't believe that for a second! As soon as my ""Six month Free"" period started, they denied me Access into the Club stating that I had to pay a ""Maintainence Fee"" or I would be denied Access. Total Bullshit, so much for being free for six months. I will never attend this club again. Total Rip Off Artists! Don't waste your $",dkGiUz_6ircqVfHJCTgQFQ

But timing of serving was awkward. After waiting for 20-30 mins for the first dish we had to wait another several several minutes for next dish. By the time we got third dish after 50 mins or so, we already lost the appetite.
